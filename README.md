Here's how concentration (aka memory) works: It's usually a single-player game -- good for only children and introverts -- but can be modified to take turns. The player, or user, can select two cards per turn. If the cards match, they remain visible. If they don't, both cards are turn back over. The game ends when all the pairs have been uncovered.<br>
